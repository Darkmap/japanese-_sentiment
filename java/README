Three jars are 3rd-party libraries for the svm classifer.

How to use?
(1) put these jars and java code in the same path
(2) javac -cp $CLASSPATH:./* Weka.java
(3) java -cp $CLASSPATH:./* Weka <input_file_path>

Notice:
if you dont input the file_path in step 3, the program will use "train.txt" under the same path. If there is no "train.txt" under current path, the program will exit with an exception.

The format of input file?
1 <word vector>
-1 <word vector>
